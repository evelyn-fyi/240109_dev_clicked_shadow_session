# 240109_dev_clicked_shadow_session
The code we wrote for the January 11th, 2024 Clicked Developer Shadow Session.

This repository contains two Apex classes and a Lightning Web Component that displays the Top 5 accounts listed by Annual Revenue. The goal of this project was to write a little bit of Apex, a little bit of an LWC, and do some declarative stuff to show off what a typical ticket might look like in the ecosystem as a Junior Salesforce Developer.

The recording for this session is here: https://youtu.be/kxzoc7v9P0Y?si=glriuNkxuHSRNpU6

For folks who want to build on this project, try forking and building:
-test classes
-functionality for the checkboxes in the lightning-datatable module
-additional LWCs for additional functionality!
  -try building something similar for the Contact object!
  -try building something record specific!
  -try building a nested LWC!
